Water the plants
I like to drive cars
The cat jumped over the fence
I like to eat apples
The sun is shining brightly
Birds sing in the morning
She smiled at me
My dog loves to play fetch
Raindrops fall softly on the ground
He runs fast
The flowers bloom in spring
The book is on the table
We went to the park yesterday
I can swim in the pool
The moon is full tonight
I enjoy watching movies
She sings beautifully
The car stopped suddenly
My mom cooks delicious meals
The tree has green leaves
The sky is blue
I feel happy today
The clock ticks loudly
The baby laughs a lot
We play games together
The horse gallops across the field
I brush my teeth every morning
The wind blows gently
I drink milk with my cereal
The stars twinkle at night
He rides his bike to school
I like to draw pictures
The butterfly flutters its wings
She reads books quietly
I hear birds singing outside
The train chugs along the tracks
The door creaks open
We walk to the store
The spider spins a web
I feel sleepy after lunch
The river flows calmly
He builds sandcastles at the beach
The fish swims in the pond
I wave goodbye to my friend
The grass feels soft under my feet
The dog barks loudly
She bakes cookies in the oven
The clouds drift across the sky
I like to ride my skateboard
The bell rings for recess
He kicks the ball into the goal
I plant flowers in the garden
The airplane flies high in the sky
We watch a movie together
The candle flickers in the wind
She writes a letter to her grandmother
I eat popcorn at the movies
The bee buzzes around the flowers
The cat purrs when I pet it
He fixes his bicycle tire
The mouse squeaks in the corner
We climb trees in the park
I pick apples from the tree
The dog wags its tail happily
She dances in the rain
I paint a picture of the sunset
The radio plays my favorite song
He hugs his teddy bear tightly
The teacher explains the lesson
I find seashells on the beach
The windmill spins in the breeze
We roast marshmallows over the fire
The owl hoots in the night
I build a sandcastle with my shovel
The cat stretches lazily
She blows bubbles with bubblegum
I ride my bike to the park
The snow falls gently from the sky
He catches a fish in the lake
The fire crackles and pops
I skip rocks across the pond
The clock ticks slowly
We have a picnic in the backyard
The squirrel gathers nuts for winter
I wear my favorite pajamas to bed
The ice cream melts in the sun
She sings a song for her friends
I play with my toys on the floor
The bird builds a nest in the tree
He blows out the birthday candles
The spider crawls up the wall
I jump rope with my friends
The rain pitter-patters on the roof
We have a snowball fight outside
The horse neighs loudly
I make a sandcastle at the beach
The cat curls up in a ball
She feeds the ducks at the pond
I fly a kite in the park
The balloon floats away into the sky
He rides a rollercoaster at the fair
We have a tea party with stuffed animals
